    "A guardrail is a set of rules and checks designed to ensure that the outputs of an LLM are accurate, appropriate, and aligned with user expectations. For more additional information on developing guardrails, you can refer to this [guide on developing guardrails](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_use_guardrails).\n",

    "2. Identifying specific criteria to measure hallucinations\n",

       "      <td>The purpose of the Product Feedback Policy is to ensure that customers can easily provide their thoughts on our products and that their input is handled professionally and constructively. This policy outlines how to collect, categorize, respond to, and act on product feedback. --- ### Step 1: **Soliciting or Receiving Feedback** 1. If the customer provides spontaneous feedback (positive or negative) about a product: - Thank the customer for their input and confirm that their feedback is highly valued. - Example: “Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts about the product! We really appreciate your feedback.” 2. If the customer requests to provide specific feedback or complete a survey: - Direct them to our feedback collection methods, such as: - Online feedback forms. - Post-purchase surveys. - Contacting customer support for detailed feedback. --- ### Step 2: **Categorize Feedback** Once feedback has been received, categorize it into one of the following groups: 1. **Positive Feedback**: The customer expresses satisfaction or enjoyment of the product. - Examples: \"I love this product!\" or \"This is the best thing I’ve bought.\" 2. **Feature Request**: The customer suggests an enhancement or addition to the product. - Examples: \"It would be great if this product came in larger sizes.\" or \"Can this feature be added in future versions?\" 3. **Negative Feedback (Constructive)**: The customer highlights areas of improvement or product flaws. - Examples: \"The product packaging was hard to open.\" or \"The instructions weren't very clear.\" 4. **Complaint**: The customer expresses dissatisfaction with the product or its performance. - Examples: \"The product stopped working after a week.\" or \"This didn’t work as advertised.\" --- ### Step 3: **Responding to Feedback** 1. For **Positive Feedback**: - Thank the customer genuinely for sharing their experience. - Example: “We’re thrilled to hear that you’re enjoying the product! Thank you for your kind words—they mean a lot to us.” - Share their feedback with the appropriate team (e.g., marketing) if relevant. 2. For **Feature Requests**: - Let the customer know their suggestion has been noted. - Example: “Thank you for your suggestion! We’re always looking for ways to improve our products, and your input has been shared with our design/development team for consideration.” 3. For **Negative Feedback (Constructive)**: - Acknowledge the feedback and apologize for any inconvenience caused. - Example: “We’re so sorry to hear that this was your experience. We’ll take your feedback into account and work on improving this aspect in the future.” - Escalate the feedback to the appropriate team (e.g., quality assurance or product development) for review. 4. For **Complaints**: - Empathize with the customer’s frustration and apologize sincerely. - Example: “We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused by this. This is not the experience we want for our customers.” - Depending on the nature of the complaint: - Offer a resolution, such as a replacement, refund, or other forms of compensation if applicable. - Ensure the complaint is escalated to a manager/team leader if necessary for resolution. --- ### Step 4: **Document Feedback** 1. Log the feedback into the company’s feedback tracking system with the following details: - Customer name and contact information (if provided). - Date the feedback was received. - Category of feedback (Positive, Feature Request, Negative Constructive, or Complaint). - Summary of feedback. - Actions taken (if any). 2. Assign the feedback to the appropriate internal team for review (e.g., product team, quality assurance). --- ### Step 5: **Follow-Up (Optional, Depending on Scenario)** 1. For major complaints or feature requests: - Follow up with the customer to inform them of any updates or resolutions taken as a result of their feedback. - Example: “We wanted to let you know that we’ve taken your feedback onboard and have made updates to improve our product. Thank you for helping us get better!” ### Step 6: **Close the Interaction** 1. Confirm with the customer if there is anything else they need support with. - Example: “Before we wrap this up, is there anything else I can assist you with today?” 2. Thank the customer again for their time and feedback. - Example: “Thank you for helping us improve! We appreciate your support.” --- By following this policy, we ensure that all customer feedback is handled promptly, respectfully, and with care, fostering trust and continuous improvement in our products and services.</td>\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate\n",
    "- It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
    "- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
    "2. Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
    "- It is important to keep relevant terms such as knowledge base articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
    "- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
    "3. Start with the most advanced model\n",
    "- There is a cost vs quality trade-off when using the most advanced models. Although GPT-4o may be more expensive, it is important to start with the most advanced model so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
    "- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to gpt-3.5-turbo\n",
    "4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
    "- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
    "- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."
